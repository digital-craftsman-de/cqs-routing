/**
 * Handler wrappers are components that allow execution of code before (`prepare`), after success (`then`) and after error (`catch`) of a
 * handler. Each method has its own priority with which it's executed in relation to other handler wrappers. Through this priority it's
 * possible to have the `prepare` method be called first for one handler wrapper but the `catch` method be triggered last.
 * This way it's possible to configure a `prepare` method of TransactionWrapper to be executed *before* the method for the LockWrapper,
 * but have the `catch` method of TransactionWrapper be triggered *after* the method of LockWrapper.
 * The priority mirrors the event listener logic from Symfony in that it's `0` as default and can usually range from `-256` to `256`.
 *
 * With handle wrappers it's possible to implement automatic transaction rollbacks, locking of requests or silent exceptions. All things
 * that are generally part of an application layer and not part of the domain.
 *
 * For now there are no built-in handler wrappers because they are highly dependant of the domain implementation and / or depend on external
 * libraries.
 *
 * It must not be used to:
 * - Handle any kind of business logic.
