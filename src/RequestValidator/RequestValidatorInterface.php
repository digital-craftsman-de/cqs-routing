/**
 * A request validator is there to validate information that is only accessible from the request itself and will not be part of the DTO or
 * must be validated before a DTO is constructed from the request data. This could include headers of a request or validation of data on an
 * application level. For example to scan uploaded files against viruses.
 *
 * Multiple request validators can be applied on each request.
 *
 *  It must not be used to:
 * - Validate request content according to business rules.
 * - Validate the existence of content that is needed for construction of command or query objects. That must be handled in the DTO constructor.
