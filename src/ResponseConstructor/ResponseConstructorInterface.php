/**
 * A response constructor is there to construct a response from the data that is returned from the handler. A command handler won't return
 * anything. Therefore, most of the time a response handler like the `EmptyResponseConstructor` will be configured for it.
 *
 * The query handler on the other hand will return a value nearly every time and depending on the use case, the value might be serialized to
 * JSON, send as binary data or even be streamed as part of a streamed response.
